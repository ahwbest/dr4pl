Version: 1.0.0
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
Author: Hyowon An
Maintainer: Hyowon An <ahwbest@gmail.com>
Description: Models the relationship between dose levels and responses in a pharmacological experiment using the 4 Parameter Logistic model. Currently only decreasing curves are supported. To deal with a convergence failure problem of nonlinear regression models, methods are provided to detect convergence failure as well as suggested solutions.
