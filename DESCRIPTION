Description: This R package models the relationship between dose levels and responses in pharmacological and toxicological experiments using the 4 Parameter Logistic (4PL) model. Traditional R packages on dose-response modelling such as drc and nplr often draw errors due to convergence failure especially when data have outliers or non-logistic shapes. We provide the bounds on the parameters of the 4PL model that prevent parameter estimates from diverging or converging to zero and base their justification in a statistical theory. As remedies to convergence failure problems, this R package provides robust estimation methods that are less affected by outliers and other initialization methods that work well for data lacking logistic shapes.
